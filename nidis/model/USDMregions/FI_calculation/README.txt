Python codes for ALL indicators:
--------------------------------

-> CalcFracMI_ClimDivs_AllValid_V2b_NDFeat_NewSeas.py  
     This code used in the JHM paper is for running any indicator's FI calculation for any USDM region after loading ALL 113 indicators to select only the samples that have valid values across all indicators.
     Note that this CalcFracMI_ClimDivs_AllValid_V2b_NDFeat_NewSeas.py file  is the initial code structure, have to convert this to final structure.

-> ClcFI_USDMRgns_AllVld_V2bPrcCrr_NDFeat_NwSs.py
     This is the NEW correct version of the above code CalcFracMI_ClimDivs_AllValid_V2b_NDFeat_NewSeas.py, and used for the final deliverables. 
     Note that this ClcFI_USDMRgns_AllVld_V2bPrcCrr_NDFeat_NwSs.py file  is the initial code structure, have to convert this to final structure.

-> CalcFracMI_ClimDivs_V2b_NDFeat_NewSeas.py
     This code used in the JHM paper is for running any indicator's FI calculation for any USDM region after loading only that indicator so that selection of its valid samples is independent of valid samples of other indicators.
     Note that this CalcFracMI_ClimDivs_V2b_NDFeat_NewSeas.py file is the initial code structure, have to convert this to final structure.

-> CalcFracMI_ClimDivs_AllValid_V2b_NDFeat_NewSeasEv.py
     This code used in the JHM paper is for running any indicator's FI calculation for any event after loading ALL 113 indicators to select only the samples that have valid values across all indicators.
     Note that this CalcFracMI_ClimDivs_AllValid_V2b_NDFeat_NewSeasEv.py file  is the initial code structure, have to convert this to final structure.
