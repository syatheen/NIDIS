-> ClcFI_ClmDvs_AllVld_V2bPrcCrr_NDFeat_NwSs.py  
     This is for running any indicator's FI calculation for any Climate Division after loading ALL 113 indicators to select only the samples that have valid values across all indicators.
     Note that this ClcFI_ClmDvs_AllVld_V2bPrcCrr_NDFeat_NwSs.py file  is the initial code structure, have to convert this to final structure.

-> ClcFI_ClmDvs_V2bPrcCrr_NDFeat_NwSs.py
     This is for running any indicator's FI calculation for any Climate Division after loading only that indicator so that selection of its valid samples is independent of valid samples of other indicators.
     Note that this ClcFI_ClmDvs_V2bPrcCrr_NDFeat_NwSs.py file is the initial code structure, have to convert this to final structure.
